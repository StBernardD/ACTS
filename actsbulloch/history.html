		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>About 1977, an interdenominational group from nine local churches founded Area Christians Together in Service (ACTS). At the time, the purpose of ACTS was to provide a Christian response to the needs of their neighbors. This response focused on providing emergency aid to those in need of food, clothing, emergency medical aid and utility assistance.</p>
		<p>Part of the ACTS mission was to pursue donations and contributions from the public in order to meet the needs of the people that receive help from ACTS.</p>
		<p>During the 1980’s and 1990’s, many area churches operated their own outreach programs, working with various state and federal agencies and, sometimes, with other churches.In May 1999, volunteers from the churches saw a real need to organize and combine various outreach programs. At this time, the organization known as ACTS was re-born.</p>
		<p>ACTS is governed by a board of directors consisting of representatives from participating churches and other interested, informed community members.</p>
